These two functions, **`getSickleData()`** and **`getHealthyData()`**, return **preloaded datasets** containing **features** extracted from sickle cells and healthy cells. Each row in the dataset represents a **cell** with three numeric features. Let’s break down what these functions are doing and what these features represent.

---

### **1. getSickleData()**

This function returns a **list of feature vectors** for several **sickle cells**. Each feature vector is a list with **three values** that describe one cell:

```python
[Area (relative), Perimeter (relative), Circularity]
```

#### **Example Row:**
```python
[0.5775517617144933, 1.1320754716981132, 0.25695125098805405]
```

- **Area (relative):** `0.577`  
  - This value represents the **relative area** of the cell compared to the average area of other cells.

- **Perimeter (relative):** `1.132`  
  - This is the **relative perimeter** of the cell compared to the average perimeter.

- **Circularity:** `0.257`  
  - This value indicates how circular the cell is. A circularity of **1** means a perfect circle. A lower value, like **0.257**, suggests an irregular (more elongated) shape, typical of **sickle cells**.

### **2. getHealthyData()**

This function returns a **list of feature vectors** for **healthy red blood cells**. Similar to the sickle data, each row contains three numeric values representing:

```python
[Area (relative), Perimeter (relative), Circularity]
```

#### **Example Row:**
```python
[1.0177914720206738, 0.9837898267188373, 0.6231258155880581]
```

- **Area (relative):** `1.018`  
  - The **area** of this cell is slightly above the average area of other cells (since it’s normalized).

- **Perimeter (relative):** `0.984`  
  - This indicates the **perimeter** of the cell relative to the average perimeter.

- **Circularity:** `0.623`  
  - This cell has a higher circularity, suggesting it is more round and regular—this is expected for **healthy red blood cells**.

### **How These Functions Are Used**

1. **Preloaded Data for Classification:**
   - These functions provide **training data** for the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** used in the project. When the system tries to classify a new cell, it compares its **area, perimeter, and circularity** with these datasets to determine if it belongs to the **sickle group** or **healthy group**.

2. **Comparison and Prediction:**
   - When the KNN classifier is run, it uses the data returned by `getSickleData()` and `getHealthyData()` to compute **distances** between the new cell's features and these preloaded datasets. The new cell is assigned to the group with the **closest matching neighbors**.

---

### **Summary**

- **`getSickleData()`**: Returns a list of feature vectors (area, perimeter, circularity) for **sickle cells**. The **circularity values** are lower, indicating the elongated shapes typical of sickle cells.
- **`getHealthyData()`**: Returns a list of feature vectors for **healthy red blood cells**, which have **higher circularity values**, indicating their regular, round shape.

These two datasets are critical for the **classification process**, helping the KNN algorithm distinguish between sickle and healthy cells based on their shape features.
